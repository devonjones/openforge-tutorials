# OpenLOCK Set

To create a basic OpenLOCK set, you will want a selection that lets you build a few small rooms, or a larger, more complex room. To that end, we suggest you start off with the following:

Requires 1-2 1 kg rolls of filament.  If you want to make the tiles magnetic, it will also reqire 364 Magnets and some cyanoacrylate glue (superglue).

* 20 E floors (2x2)
* 8 F floors (2x2, curved)
* 4 U floors (4x4)
* 20 A walls
* 4 BA walls <- Strongly suggest you do this one in triplex even if doing magnetic for everything else
* 8 G walls
* 2 IA <- Suggest you do this one in triplex too
* 4 Q walls
* 4 A doors
* 2 Q doors
* 2 A windows

If doing low walls, print these columns:

* 4 I low columns
* 8 O low columns

If doing normal height walls, print these columns:

* 4 I columns
* 8 L columns (used for corners)
* 4 O columns
* 4 X columns
* 4 T columns

When picking what you want to print, you are going to first want to decide if you are going to glue pieces or not. If you don't want to glue anything, select the files named [set]_wall.inch.[letter].low.triplex.?. If you want magnets, then select [set]_wall.inch.[letter].low.openforge.?. It is *not* critical that every wall be the same.  The rules for floors are similar.  Triplex tiles print as one piece, openforge tiles print as two, and require a glued base.

If you are using the openforge varients, you will also need to print a base: [set]_base.inch.[letter].openlock.magnetic.?.

Second you will want to decide if you want sidelocking. Odds are you do. For that, select files with .side. in the name.

Finally you will want to choose if you want pegs. Pegs are used for indexing a second floor. If you never plan on building multi floor layouts, skip them. Even if you do, you may not want them on all tiles, as they can interfere with the aesthetics a little. We print them on about half of our A walls, which gives enough to index an upper layer if you want.
