# Basic Set

To create a basic set, you will want a selection that lets you build a few small rooms, or a larger, more complex room. To that end, we suggest you start off with the following:

Requires 1-2 1 kg rolls of filament and 376 Magnets.  You will also need some cyanoacrylate glue (superglue).

* 14 2x2 walls
* 8 2x2 corners
* 12 2x2 floors
* 2 4x4 floors
* 4 2x2 doors
* 2 4x2 wide doors
* 2 2x2 windows

For flexibility, and to maximize the chances of producing usable parts we suggest using construction kit versions of tiles wherever possible.

## Cut-Stone

376 Magnets

* Walls
  * [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1419276) as one piece
  * [Wall Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1640988) & [Wall Backs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641002) as a construction kit
  * 14x cut_stone_floor.2x2.internal.ckit
  * 14x cut_stone_wall.2x.internal.standard.ckit
* Corners
  * [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1434550) as one piece
  * [Corner Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727359) & [Corner Backs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727402) as a constuction kit
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1422779)
* Doors
  * [Arched Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1440089) or [Wood Frame Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1722459) (consider doing a full set of both)
  * [Wall Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1640988) & [Wall Backs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641002) as a construction kit.  Wall backs contains every variety of cut-stone backs for the construction kit.
  * 4x (arched) cut_stone_door.2xW.internal.standard.ckit
  * 4x (wood frame) cut_stone_door_square.stone_floor.2xW.internal.standard.ckit + door_lintel_1, 2 or 3
  * 4x cut_stone_floor.2x2.internal.ckit
  * 4x 2x2 square base in the connector style you prefer
* [Arched Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1541301) or [Square Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1674376) (consider doing a full set of both)

## Cut-Stone Half-Height

Windows and Doors don't make much sense at half-height.  If your goal is to create a set that lets you easily see the miniatures, we suggest printing the half-height set and then printing full height doors and windows above.

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1591395)
* [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598304)
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1422779) (Same as Cut-Stone floors above)

## Rough Stone
Rough stone is a varation of ruined stone, where the pieces are complete.  If you print rough stone, we suggest also printing the full range of ruined variations, as the two work really well together to make partially intact buildings or rooms.

400 Magnets

## Ruined Stone
Ruined stone is a varation of rough stone, where the pieces are not entirely complete.  If you print rough stone, we suggest also printing the full range of ruined variations, as the two work really well together to make partially intact buildings or rooms.
